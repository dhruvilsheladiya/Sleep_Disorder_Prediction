# Sleep Disorder Prediction Model

This project aims to predict sleep disorders in patients using machine learning. The model utilizes various features related to the patient's health and lifestyle to make predictions. The deployment of the model is done using Streamlit and is hosted on Streamlit Share.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:
- Age: Age of the patient
- Sleep Duration: Duration of sleep in hours
- Systolic: Systolic blood pressure
- Daily Steps: Number of steps taken daily
- Heart Rate: Heart rate of the patient
- Quality of Sleep: Self-reported quality of sleep
- Physical Activity Level: Level of physical activity
- Diastolic: Diastolic blood pressure
- Sleep Disorder: Indicating the sleep disorder of the patient

## Model Building

The model was built using machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of a sleep disorder based on the provided features. Various algorithms were tested and the best performing one was selected for deployment.

## Deployment

The model is deployed using Streamlit, a web application framework for machine learning and data science projects. The deployment is hosted on Streamlit Share and can be accessed at [https://sleep-disorder-model.streamlit.app/](https://sleep-disorder-model.streamlit.app/).

## Performance

The model achieves an accuracy of 96% in predicting the presence of a sleep disorder in patients. This high accuracy demonstrates the effectiveness of the model in identifying potential sleep disorders based on the input features.
